    <p>I’m Nael Fessha, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech who enjoys building and understanding systems from the ground up. I believe engineering is about solving real problems that improve how people live and work.</p>

    <p>Curiosity led me here — from tinkering with hardware at home to programming embedded devices that sense and respond to the world. I value teamwork, iteration, and continuous learning, which shape how I approach both projects and collaboration.</p>

    <h3>My Elevator Pitch</h3>
