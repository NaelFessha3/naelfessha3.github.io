    <p>My long-term goal is to design and develop embedded systems that bridge the gap between hardware and intelligent software — especially in robotics, IoT, or smart energy applications. I want to contribute to systems that are efficient, connected, and sustainable.</p>

    <h3>My Roadmap</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gain hands-on experience through co-ops or internships in embedded systems.</li>
      <li>Master C/C++, real-time operating systems, and microcontroller design.</li>
      <li>Contribute to open-source hardware and IoT frameworks.</li>
      <li>Earn advanced certifications in embedded design or networking.</li>
      <li>Grow into a systems engineer or R&D role focusing on intelligent hardware.</li>
    </ol>
