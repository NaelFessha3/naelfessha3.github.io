## 1. Welcome / Introduction

Hello! I’m **[Your Name]**, an undergraduate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech** with a growing interest in embedded systems, data-oriented applications, and building things that actually work in the real world. This ePortfolio is a living space where I document who I am, what I’ve built, and where I’m headed.

In this ePortfolio you will find:
- A short story of how I got into engineering
- A résumé you can view and download
- My long-term career goals and the steps I’m taking
- A technical project sample (including my Discovery Project) with visuals

## 2. About Me / Biography

I’ve always liked understanding *how* things work — not just using technology, but opening it up, tracing wires, and asking why a certain decision was made. That curiosity is what guided me to ECE at Georgia Tech. I enjoy the discipline because it sits in a sweet spot: it’s close enough to hardware that I can appreciate signals, circuits, and constraints, but it’s also close enough to software that I can build useful, people-facing tools.

I grew up solving practical problems at home — from fixing a broken router to helping family members set up devices. Over time, those small tasks turned into a mindset: **engineering is about reducing friction in people’s lives**. At Tech, I’ve been leaning into that mindset through coursework, labs, and small side projects.

Some themes that describe me:
- **Story-driven communicator**: I like to explain projects in terms of who they help and what problem they solve, not just specs.
- **Hands-on builder**: I prefer to prototype early and validate quickly.
- **Team-friendly**: I like multidisciplinary projects where one person handles hardware, another firmware, another UI — and we make it all talk.

In the **Elevator Pitch Workshop** we emphasized clarity, confidence, and relevance. My pitch, adapted for this portfolio, would be:

> “Hi, I’m [Your Name], an ECE student at Georgia Tech focused on building embedded and data-driven systems that solve real problems. I enjoy taking ideas from ‘this would be cool’ to ‘this is running on hardware,’ and I’m actively building a portfolio that shows I can contribute to product teams and research groups.”

Outside of class, I enjoy documenting what I learn, mentoring peers on how to present technical work, and following industry trends in edge computing and connected devices. My goal is not only to **be employable**, but to **be useful** — someone who can enter a team and make progress from day one.
