    <h2>Discovery Project Idea – Starting Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      For my Discovery Project, I wanted to build something practical that also helped me learn real electrical and
      computer engineering skills. My initial idea was to create a temperature-controlled fan system that could
      automatically adjust its speed based on surrounding temperature.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Progress</h2>
    <p>
      I began by selecting all required components for the system: an Arduino Uno, DHT11 temperature sensor, 16x2 LCD,
      L298N motor driver, and a 5V DC fan. I first verified the sensor by reading temperature in the Serial Monitor,
      then displayed it on the LCD. After wiring the motor driver, I programmed the fan to change speeds based on
      temperature ranges. Finally, I combined all subsystems into one working unit.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Successes and Failures</h2>
    <p>
      During development I experienced several challenges, such as the LCD dimming when the fan activated due to voltage
      drops, and larger fans drawing too much current for the Arduino. I solved these by improving power management and
      using smaller fans with lower current demands. Despite these issues, I had multiple successes including accurate
      temperature readings, responsive fan control, and a fully functioning integrated system.
    </p>

    <h2>ECE Skills Gained</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microcontroller programming using Arduino C/C++</li>
      <li>Sensor integration with the DHT11</li>
      <li>Circuit prototyping and breadboard wiring</li>
      <li>PWM-based motor speed control</li>
      <li>Debugging hardware and software interactions</li>
      <li>Understanding power supply requirements and driver limitations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      This project increased my interest in embedded systems and reinforced my understanding of electrical engineering
      concepts. It helped me gain hands-on knowledge of sensors, displays, motor drivers, and microcontroller
      programming. In the future, I hope to expand this project by adding humidity-based control, a better driver, and
      possibly a Bluetooth/mobile interface for remote monitoring.
